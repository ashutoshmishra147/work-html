Single or Double Quotes?
<hr>

<p title="About W3Schools">
You cannot omit quotes around an attribute value 
if the value contains spaces.
</p>

Double style quotes are the most common in HTML, but 

single style can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself 

contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single 

quotes:

<p title='Amar "Akbar" Anthony'>  in para 2 </p>

Or vice versa:

<p title="Amar 'Akbar' Anthony"> in para 3 </p>
